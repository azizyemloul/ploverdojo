Plover Dojo
===========
Plover Dojo is a [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/) project aimed to aid people in the learning of stenography on a standard computer keyboard through [Plover](http://plover.stenoknight.com/). The target audience is intended to be those who have some touch typing experience on a standard computer keyboard, but *no* experience with stenography.
